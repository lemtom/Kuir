# Kuir Recipe Manager

Work-in-progress recipe manager using JavaFX. Currently recipes can be added in-memory and displayed in a table. Double-clicking on a recipe in the table opens a non-functional viewer.

## Further plans

The original plan included:

* Finishing the viewer
* Allowing recipes to be edited
* Saving recipes as JSON files in a format based on [the Recipe Schema](https://schema.org/Recipe)
* Export to and import of various other formats
